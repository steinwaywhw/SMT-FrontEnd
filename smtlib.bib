Standard techniques usually relax the initial problem to the rational domain and then proceed either by projection (e.g. Omega-Test) or by branching/cutting methods (branch-and-bound, branch-and-cut, Gomory cuts). Our approach tries to bridge the gap between the two techniques: it interleaves an exhaustive search for a model with bounds inference. These bounds are computed provided an oracle capable of finding constant positive linear combinations of affine forms. We also show how to design an efficient oracle based on the Simplex procedure. Our algorithm is proved sound, complete, and terminating and is implemented in the Alt-Ergo theorem prover. Experimental results are promising and show that our approach is competitive with state-of-the-art SMT solvers.}},

	abstract = {{'Satisfiability} ({SAT)} related topics have attracted researchers from various disciplines: logic, applied areas such as planning, scheduling, operations research and combinatorial optimization, but also theoretical issues on the theme of complexity and much more, they all are connected through {SAT.} My personal interest in {SAT} stems from actual solving: The increase in power of modern {SAT} solvers over the past 15 years has been phenomenal. It has become the key enabling technology in automated verification of both computer hardware and software. Bounded Model Checking ({BMC)} of computer hardware is now probably the most widely used model checking technique. The counterexamples that it finds are just satisfying instances of a Boolean formula obtained by unwinding to some fixed depth a sequential circuit and its specification in linear temporal logic. Extending model checking to software verification is a much more difficult problem on the frontier of current research. One promising approach for languages like C with finite word-length integers is to use the same idea as in {BMC} but with a decision procedure for the theory of bit-vectors instead of {SAT.} All decision procedures for bit-vectors that I am familiar with ultimately make use of a fast {SAT} solver to handle complex formulas. Decision procedures for more complicated theories, like linear real and integer arithmetic, are also used in program verification. Most of them use powerful {SAT} solvers in an essential way. Clearly, efficient {SAT} solving is a key technology for 21st century computer science. I expect this collection of papers on all theoretical and practical aspects of {SAT} solving will be extremely useful to both students and researchers and will lead to many further advances in the field.'
